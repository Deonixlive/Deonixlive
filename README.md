# Dime, Deonix

Welcome to my GitHub — a space where deep learning meets practical engineering. I'm a CS student passionate about building intelligent systems, crafting useful tools, and exploring the intersections of Machine Learning, data visualization, and infrastructure.

## About Me

I'm currently diving deep into neural networks, deploying smart systems, and building everything from autonomous FPV drones, visualizing data to secure, containerized environments. Whether it's analyzing data, experimenting with reinforcement learning, or building backend tools, I’m always looking to push boundaries with code.

## Selected Projects

### [modulated-DQN](https://github.com/Deonixlive/modulated-DQN)
A flexible and efficient spin on Deep Q-Networks, designed to be more modular, faster to train, and easier to extend — ideal for experimenting with reinforcement learning.

### [Library for Autonomous FPV-Drones](https://github.com/Deonixlive/Control-Betaflight-Copter)
An easy way to control FPV Drones equipped with Betaflight. It also includes a highly performant asynchronous implementation of the MSP protocol with a priority structure for commands.

### [PA-net](https://github.com/Deonixlive/PA-net)
A lightweight convolutional neural network for digit recognition, with deployment in mind. A good example of clean architecture and a tight feedback loop between training and testing.
