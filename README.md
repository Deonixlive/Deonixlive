# Dimetri Chau

Welcome to my GitHub — a space where deep learning meets practical engineering. I'm a CS student passionate about building intelligent systems, crafting useful tools, and exploring the intersections of AI, UI, and infrastructure.

## About Me

I'm currently diving deep into neural networks, deploying smart systems, and building everything from visualizing data to secure, containerized environments. Whether it's analyzing data, experimenting with reinforcement learning, or building backend tools, I’m always looking to push boundaries with code.

## Selected Projects

### [modulated-DQN](https://github.com/Deonixlive/modulated-DQN)
A flexible and efficient spin on Deep Q-Networks, designed to be more modular, faster to train, and easier to extend — ideal for experimenting with reinforcement learning.

### [PA-net](https://github.com/Deonixlive/PA-net)
A lightweight convolutional neural network for digit recognition, with deployment in mind. A good example of clean architecture and a tight feedback loop between training and testing.

### [rpsgame](https://github.com/Deonixlive/rpsgame)
A fun implementation of Rock-Paper-Scissors with a Python-based UI — proof that even simple games can be smart, interactive, and polished.
